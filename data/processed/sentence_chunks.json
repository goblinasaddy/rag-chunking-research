The educational process is ideally conducted in an environment that encourages\nreasoned discourse, intellectual honesty, openness, and respect for the rights of all individuals. Self -discipline is necessary for the fulfilment of such goals. The Students’ Ethics is insisted on\npromoting this environment in the University, not limiting to areas stated herein below:\n• Respect for self\n• Respect for others\n• Respect for University Assets\n• Respect for University Authority\n• Honesty, Professional and Academic Integrity, Demeanor\n• Student Code of Conduct\n56\n6. 0 OFFICE OF STUDENT SUCCESS\nWith over three decades of remarkable accomplishments and countless success stories, Amity\nUniversity has emerged as a model for holistic and progressive development of students. As a\nforward-thinking University committed to global outlook, we uphold a vision of academic\nexcellence, value-based education, and life skills development grounded in respect,\nresponsibility, accountability, trust, and transparency. Academic success and happiness are\ndeeply interconnected. Happiness, a state of positive emotion and fulfilment, plays a vital role\nin overall satisfaction and personal growth. In alignment with this vision, we have established the Office of Student Success (OSS)—\na centralized initiative designed to nurture student success and well-being from admission to\ngraduation and beyond. The Office of Student Success aims to provide a comprehensive,\ninclusive, and continuous support system that shapes and enhances the student\njourney—from entry into the University to the life even after graduation. The Office of Student Success is more than a service unit—it’s a commitment to every\nstudent’s personal and academic journey. By addressing every touchpoint in the student\nlifecycle with empathy, clarity, and strategic intent, OSS fosters a culture of success, well-\nbeing, and life-long connection with the University. Office of Student Success also serves as the final touchpoint for resolution of any issues and\nproblems remaining unresolved at all the levels provided by the University for resolution. Students can easily approach OSS for resolution of such issues with full details of the efforts\nalready made by them for resolution. 57\n7. 0 ESCALATION MATRIX (AUUP)\nProblem Area Level Designation\nAcademics 1 HoI\n2 Dean (SS&AA)\n3 Dean (Academics)\n4 Addl.
